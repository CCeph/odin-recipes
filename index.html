    <h2>Why is this Important?</h2>

        <p>It is unfortunate that in our current fast-paced world, people's health tends to be neglected, especially their diets. The most frequent issues observed in the diets of our current generation is a high sodium intake and a lack of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). This website offers a very brief selection of recipes that I think are healthy, tasty, and quite easy to make. For the university students out there who consist of 70% ramen noodles rather than water, I promise that these recipes are worth the slight more effort, but you will thank yourself in the future for eating healthier now.</p>
