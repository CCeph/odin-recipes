    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This delicious and healthy recipe is cooked in a <strong>slow cooker</strong>, so it is very easy and convenient to prepare. Despite the dish taking about five and a half hours to cook, you will only really spend about an hour in the kitchen. Note that if you prefer, you can replace the rice in this recipe with couscous or pita bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
            <li>8 bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained </li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained </li>
            <li>12 marinated artichoke hearts, drained </li>
            <li>4 large carrots, chopped </li>
            <li>4 large garlic cloves, halved </li>
            <li>1 (3 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 large sweet onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ pound green beans, trimmed and halved</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>¼ cup coarsely chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>2 cups rice</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix 1 tsp of tumeric, ginger, coriander, salt, and ¼ tsp of cumin and cayenne pepper in a small cup.</li>
            <li>Rub the mixture over the chicken and let it sit for at least 30 mins</li>
            <li>Chop the carrots and cut the garlic cloves in half.</li>
            <li>Add the chickpeas, diced tomatoes, artichoke hearts, carrots, garlic, and cinnamon stick in the bottom of a 6 to 7-quart slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to the slow cooker, bone-side-up.</li>
            <li>Add onion to the same skillet the chicken was seared in. Saute over medium-high heat until onions have taken on a yellow color from turmeric and are starting to brown on the edges. Transfer to the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Cover the slow cooker and cook on Low for approximately 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Place green beans and bell pepper over chicken. Cover and cook approximately 3 hours more.</li>
            <li>In the last hour of the slow cooker, prepare the rice. Wash 3 cups of rice, then add it to a saucepan. Add oil, and the amount of water desired (if using long grain rice, it is suggested to use 1.5 cups of water for each cup of rice). Bring the water to a boil then cover the saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the rice on each plate and then top it with the chicken and vegetables. Add the juices from the slow cooker on each serving.</li>
        </ol>
