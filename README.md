# odin-recipes

I will create a website that contains 4 webpages. The home webpage will link to
3 webpages about 3 recipes. The 3 webpages will include a title, picture,
summary, list of ingredients, and list of steps for the recipe.

By the end of this project, I should have demonstrated my ability to use HTML
to create a very basic website. I will show that I can create a HTML boilerplate,
and use commands for headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists.

I will also demonstrate my ability to work with git and github, and the ability
to write good commit comments.
