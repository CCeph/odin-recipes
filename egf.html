    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Arguably the easiest main dish to ever exist, egg fried rice. Depending on how good you are, you can be in and out of the kitchen with this delicious dish in as little as 15 minutes. If you are one with the noodles, I strongly suggest giving this a try as you're getting a much more balanced meal for little extra effort. Note that this recipe assumes (and recommends) that you already have some cooked rice from before. However, if you do not have leftover rice, just steam some rice prior to following the steps on this recipe. There is no excuse not to cook when this dish exists!</p>
