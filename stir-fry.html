    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This is a delicious and well-balanced meal. With a total prep and cooking time of about 1 hour, this is also a very easy dish to cook. The suggested portions should provide about 4 servings.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
            <li>½ cup canned bamboo shoots, drained</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped yellow bell pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped orange bell pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup thinly sliced green onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked long-grain white rice</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked wild rice </li>
            <li>Teriyaki Dressing</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the rice by washing it until the water is clear. Then, add it to a saucepan, add oil, and about 1.5 cups of water for each cup of rice. Add salt according to preference. Bring to a boil then let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add teriyaki dressing in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat while stirring constantly. Cook until the mixture thickens slightly. Then remove and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add vegetable oil and heat until shimmering, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chicken and garlic; stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Add broccoli and continue to stir-fry, 4 to 6 minutes. Add bamboo shoots and bell peppers; cook for an additional 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour the teriyaki dressing into the skillet (watch for splattering); cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, and the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in green onion and sesame seeds, reserving some of each for garnish. Serve immediately over cooked white and wild rice with the reserved green onions and sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
